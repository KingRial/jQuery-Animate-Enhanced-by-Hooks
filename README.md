Notes
-----
After using for a long time the jQuery-Animate-Enhanced from Ben Barnett (http://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced), I met some problems.
All the jquery queue for animations wasn't anymore compatible with such great plugins.
I tried to patch such great library without success, so I decided to create my own plugin trying to build a less complex solution withing the jQuery environment.

Special Thanks to:
Ben Barnett for http://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced
louisremi for https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transition.js/

Improvements
-----
A lot of improvements can still be done; for example adding more css transformations or let the plugin using the easings set into animate function.
